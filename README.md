# Project2-DataAnalytics-ETL

ReadMe

Welcome to the ReadMe for our data analytics ETL project. In this ReadMe, we will provide anoverview of the project goal and the analysis contained in this repository.

The goal of this project was to obtain at least two data files from a reliable source, ideally in .csv or .json file type. The data source we access was credit card application data used to predict the credit application approvals (宋骁 Seanny 2019).   We then used a combination of Postgres, Python, and other ETL frameworks to extract, transform, and load the data, while ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the resulting dataset.
Throughout the project, we worked closely as a team to design and implement the ETL process. Using Jupyter Notebooks to ensure code was executed correctly, and fix errors were appropriate.

This GitHub respository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to conduct the ETL, as well as a technical report that further details the analysis.
The original datasources can be found in the Resources folder within this respostiory.
